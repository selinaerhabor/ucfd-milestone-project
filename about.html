                    The Kinks were an English Rock band formed in Muswell Hill in 1963 by Ray and Dave Davies. Formerly known 
                    as The Ravens when first formed in 1963, until later changing their name to The Kinks in 1964.
                    Like most bands of their era, the Kinks began as an R&B/blues outfit. 
                  </div>
                    As teenagers, the brothers began playing skiffle and rock & roll. The brothers recruited a schoolmate called Peter Quaife 
                    to play with them. Quaife also played guitar, but he switched to bass. 
                    Within four years, the band had become the most staunchly English of all their contemporaries, drawing heavily from 
                    British music hall and traditional pop, as well as incorporating elements of country, folk, and blues.
                  <div class="hidden-xs">
                    American record producer, Sheldon "Shel" Talmy under contract to Pye Records,
                    helped the band land a contract with Pye in 1964. Before signing to the label, Mick Avory joined the band as their drummer. 
                    Other members including John Dalton and Jim Rodford covered bass after Pete Quaife left in 1969.
                    John Gosling joined the band in 1970 as their keyboardist. From 1978, other members including Ian Gibbons covered the keyboardist role.
                    Throughout their long and varied career, the core of the Kinks remained the Davies brothers.
