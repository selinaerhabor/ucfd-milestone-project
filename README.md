# UCFD Milestone Project: The Kinks' Website

Site is live at **https://selinaerhabor.github.io/ucfd-milestone-project/**.

The User Centric Front-End Development (UCFD) Milestone project was to build a static front-end only website for a 1960s Rock band
with around 50 years experience performing live. The chosen Rock band is the English music group - The Kinks.

Website Page Names: Index, About, Music, Photos, Events and Store.


## User Experience Design

The band's main requirements for this site: 
* Photos of the band members
* A video clip
* Audio clips
* Showcase their music and increase awareness of their availability to perform at events
* Provide links to their social media pages to improve their social media presence

The primary target audience of this website are fans and potential fans of the rock 
band who are interested in viewing clips of the band and the band’s work. 

Firstly, I gathered users’ opinions on what they feel a 1960s band website should showcase. 
From the ease of navigation to old fashioned photos, I collected several user stories:

As a user, I’ll be interested in... 
* "Simple and easy access through navigation across the website”
* "Old fashioned photos – black and white style”
* "1960s Culture/dressing/outfit/wears”
* "Seeing obsolete/old musical instruments and equipment”
* "Seeing how the band relates to audience, introduction speeches/stage performances”
* "Ease to buy The Kinks’ merchandise”
* "Ease to send requests for booking to perform at weddings/other parties”
* "Ease of using website on mobile phones as well as desktops or other devices”
